## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

With this challenge, I learned a bit more about the structuring of HTML in general, as well as a better understanding of CSS properties in terms of Flexbox and CSSGrid. I have also used some new CSS properties for myself, which I hope to implement in future projects.

## Acknowledgments

Mostly I have tried to make all the code from scratch based on my knowledge, but there were some aspects of the challenge that were a bit difficult for me to implement any feasible solution. Being my first challenge, I have looked for a tutorial from someone who has done the same challenge following more or less the structure that I had established on my own. Although there are many people who found different solutions, I can say that in this channel I use a line of thought similar to mine, so I was inspired by some of their solutions to apply in my code, which has some differences.
